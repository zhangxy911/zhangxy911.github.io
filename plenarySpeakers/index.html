    <div class="content">
    <strong>Dipartimento di Scienze dell'Ingegneria Civile e Ambientale Politecnico di Bari, Bari, Italy</strong><br><br>
    The comprehension of the role of mechanical forces at the molecular level represents nowadays the focus of 
    incredible efforts in many different research fields of Biology, Biomechanics, Material Engineering, Biomedical
    Sciences. Fundamental phenomena such as DNA and RNA hairpins unfolding and refolding in enzymatic activity,
    sensing of metabolites, transcription termination and attenuation, morphogenic phenomena, cell motility, 
    focal adhesion and so on cannot be described without a comprehension of mechanical fields effect and
    macromolecular and cells force-response. Single-molecule stretching experiments opened up the possibility 
    of an impressive progress in in this direction. <br> <br>

    We describe in the framework of Statistical Mechanics the experimentally observed mechanical behavior of different
    protein macromolecules under cyclic stretching experiments. The proposed models reproduce quantitatively known 
    observed phenomena such as stretch induced domains unfolding and refolding, softening and variation of reference 
    configuration. Based on such microscale description, we then propose multiscale approaches to deduce the macroscopic
    material response depending on few constitutive parameters with a clear physical interpretation. <br> <br>

    To analyze the effectiveness of the proposed models we tested the macroscopic cyclic behavior of spider silks and 
    of a keratin proteins such as human, cow and rabbit hairs. By adopting experimental values of the macromolecular
    material parameters, we show that the model reproduces with surprising accuracy the obtained experimental behavior
    with a strongly non linear damage, dissipation and large permanent stretches. These results represent in our 
    opinion also a significant step forward in the perspective of the design of new bioinspired history dependent 
    materials.

      <button type="button" class="collapsible">Title: Reliability modeling and error predicting for industrial robots</button>
      <div class="content">
      <strong>State Key Laboratory of Reliability and Intelligence of Electrical Equipment, School of Mechanical Engineering, Hebei University of Technology, Tianjin, 300401, P. R. China</strong><br><br>
        The industrial robot is composed of mechanical structure, drive system, control system and perception system. 
        The analysis of industrial robots involves reliability modeling, reliability design, reliability evaluation and 
        reliability experiment, making the reliability analysis process more complex and difficult than the traditional 
        mechanical products. In order to ensure the high performance of reliability of the robots, the modeling, simulating,
        predicting as well as the testing of the robots should be systematically investigated. This talk will present our
        recent research works on reliability modeling and error prediction methods for industrial robots, including:
        kinematic reliability modeling and analysis, dynamics reliability modeling and analysis, error field modeling 
        and precision predicting. A computational framework of kinematic accuracy reliability analysis is proposed to 
        evaluate comprehensively the positional accuracy reliability for single coordinate, single point, multipoint 
        and trajectory accuracy for industrial robots. The computational accuracy and efficiency are significantly 
        improved compared to the traditional competitive approaches. In terms of dynamics reliability modeling and analysis, 
        a rotational sparse grid method for statistical moment evaluation and dynamics reliability analysis with enhanced 
        accuracy and efficiency is presented. Then, an error predicting method is proposed to evaluate the error values at
        any position in three-dimensional space stimulated by neural network technique. In this way, off-line precision 
        compensation for industrial robots can be easily realized. Finally, a series of reliability experiments and
        reliability analysis tools are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods. <br> <br>
