    The past few decades have witnessed significant advancements in developing hybrid structures by integrating fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) composites 
    with conventional materials (e.g., concrete and steel). By strategically exploiting the individual strengths of each constituent, these hybrid 
    structures can achieve exceptional structural performance and enhanced durability. Numerical modeling has emerged as a crucial and potent tool 
    for accurately predicting and interpreting the behavior of such hybrid structures. This mini-symposium aims to bring together leading researchers

        The micro-/nano-structures and interfaces design has led to vigorous development of materials science and solid-state physics in recent decades. 
        Interface design is a key approach to improve the performance of materials, via tailoring the interfaces between solids, liquids, gases, 
        as well as other heterogeneous interfaces (such as surface, grain/twin/phase boundary, crack, adhesion and friction, etc.). It involves not 
        only multi-field coupling of mechanics, heat, electricity, and magnetism etc., but also the correlation  between different micro-/nano-structures 
        and interfaces. Micro-/nano-structures and Interface modeling is able to guide/accelerate the development of high-performance micro-/nano-materials 
        and structures in nano energy, batteries, fuel cells, information storage and so forth. This mini-symposium aims at gathering researchers from

        Fire safety is a significant issue both for industrial and residential regions. The fire disasters in developing countries are particularly serious
        and the more rapid the development is, the more fires may happen in any single country. Therefore, it is very necessary and a big need to develop 
        fire protection engineering in any living and manufacturing aspects, including structural engineering, energy industry,  building safety and wildland. 
        Fire modeling can be both experimental and numerical studies to simulate or investigate the fire behavior in urban or wildland area. 
        As a multidisciplinary subject, this improvement of fire safety welcomes and needs deep discussion and cooperation between subjects or countries, 
        especially in Asia where urbanization and population are increasing rapidly. Therefore, this mini-symposium provides an open and friendly forum 
        for researchers from all over the world to discuss and present the relevant work about fire safety modeling in developing countries. Submissions 
        are encouraged on, but not limited to, the following topics: <br>
        -Material behavior modeling in fires (steel, concrete, glass and combustible materials, etc.) <br>
        -Fire dynamics (compartment fires, pool fires and tunnel fires) <br>
        -Fire chemistry (chemical kinetics, material toxicity, and flame retardants) <br>
        -Structural fire <br>
        -Fire suppression simulation <br>
        -Wildland, urban and WUI Fires (e.g. informal settlement fire) <br>
        -The modeling of evacuation in a fire <br>
        -Fire risk analysis and fire safety design <br>
        -Fire safety management and education <br><br>
