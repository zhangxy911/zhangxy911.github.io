    <h4>Title:Damage, healing and residual strains in biological materials: from molecular to macroscopic scale</h4>
    <h5>Dipartimento di Scienze dell'Ingegneria Civile e Ambientale Politecnico di Bari, Bari, Italy</h5> <br>
    
    The comprehension of the role of mechanical forces at the molecular level represents nowadays the focus of 
    incredible efforts in many different research fields of Biology, Biomechanics, Material Engineering, Biomedical
    Sciences. Fundamental phenomena such as DNA and RNA hairpins unfolding and refolding in enzymatic activity,
    sensing of metabolites, transcription termination and attenuation, morphogenic phenomena, cell motility, 
    focal adhesion and so on cannot be described without a comprehension of mechanical fields effect and
    macromolecular and cells force-response. Single-molecule stretching experiments opened up the possibility 
    of an impressive progress in in this direction.

    We describe in the framework of Statistical Mechanics the experimentally observed mechanical behavior of different
    protein macromolecules under cyclic stretching experiments. The proposed models reproduce quantitatively known 
    observed phenomena such as stretch induced domains unfolding and refolding, softening and variation of reference 
    configuration. Based on such microscale description, we then propose multiscale approaches to deduce the macroscopic
    material response depending on few constitutive parameters with a clear physical interpretation.

    To analyze the effectiveness of the proposed models we tested the macroscopic cyclic behavior of spider silks and 
    of a keratin proteins such as human, cow and rabbit hairs. By adopting experimental values of the macromolecular
    material parameters, we show that the model reproduces with surprising accuracy the obtained experimental behavior
    with a strongly non linear damage, dissipation and large permanent stretches. These results represent in our 
    opinion also a significant step forward in the perspective of the design of new bioinspired history dependent 
    materials.

    <h4>Title:Reliability modeling and error predicting for industrial robots</h4>
    <h5>State Key Laboratory of Reliability and Intelligence of Electrical Equipment, School of Mechanical Engineering, Hebei University of Technology, Tianjin, 300401, P. R. China</h5> <br>
    
    The industrial robot is composed of mechanical structure, drive system, control system and perception system. 
    The analysis of industrial robots involves reliability modeling, reliability design, reliability evaluation and 
    reliability experiment, making the reliability analysis process more complex and difficult than the traditional 
    mechanical products. In order to ensure the high performance of reliability of the robots, the modeling, simulating,
    predicting as well as the testing of the robots should be systematically investigated. This talk will present our
    recent research works on reliability modeling and error prediction methods for industrial robots, including:
    kinematic reliability modeling and analysis, dynamics reliability modeling and analysis, error field modeling 
    and precision predicting. A computational framework of kinematic accuracy reliability analysis is proposed to 
    evaluate comprehensively the positional accuracy reliability for single coordinate, single point, multipoint 
    and trajectory accuracy for industrial robots. The computational accuracy and efficiency are significantly 
    improved compared to the traditional competitive approaches. In terms of dynamics reliability modeling and analysis, 
    a rotational sparse grid method for statistical moment evaluation and dynamics reliability analysis with enhanced 
    accuracy and efficiency is presented. Then, an error predicting method is proposed to evaluate the error values at
    any position in three-dimensional space stimulated by neural network technique. In this way, off-line precision 
    compensation for industrial robots can be easily realized. Finally, a series of reliability experiments and
    reliability analysis tools are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

    Fire safety is a significant issue both for industrial and residential regions. The fire disasters in developing countries are particularly serious
     and the more rapid the development is, the more fires may happen in any single country. Therefore, it is very necessary and a big need to develop 
     fire protection engineering in any living and manufacturing aspects, including structural engineering, energy industry,  building safety and wildland. 
     Fire modeling can be both experimental and numerical studies to simulate or investigate the fire behavior in urban or wildland area. 
     As a multidisciplinary subject, this improvement of fire safety welcomes and needs deep discussion and cooperation between subjects or countries, 
     especially in Asia where urbanization and population are increasing rapidly. Therefore, this mini-symposium provides an open and friendly forum 
     for researchers from all over the world to discuss and present the relevant work about fire safety modeling in developing countries. Submissions 
     are encouraged on, but not limited to, the following topics: <br>
     -Material behavior modeling in fires (steel, concrete, glass and combustible materials, etc.) <br>
     -Fire dynamics (compartment fires, pool fires and tunnel fires) <br>
     -Fire chemistry (chemical kinetics, material toxicity, and flame retardants) <br>
     -Structural fire <br>
     -Fire suppression simulation <br>
     -Wildland, urban and WUI Fires (e.g. informal settlement fire) <br>
     -The modeling of evacuation in a fire <br>
     -Fire risk analysis and fire safety design <br>
     -Fire safety management and education <br>
